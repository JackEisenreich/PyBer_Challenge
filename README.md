# PyBer_Challenge

**Overview of the analysis:**

The purpose of this analysis was to first compare the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver in 3 different community types (urban, suburban, and rural) for PyBer. We then looked at the total fares per week for each of these communities on a weekly basis for the first four months of 2019.

**Results:**

When looking at the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, the rural community had the highest average fares, followed by the suburban community and lastly the urban community.

However, when you look at the total fares, the urban community has the highest. This is all probably because the larger number of drivers and increased demand for rides in urban areas. Because there is more supply in this area it makes sense that the average fare is lower here. There are more rides and more drivers the higher the population of the community is.

On a weekly basis, the urban community has much higher total fares than the suburban and rural communities as well.

**Summary:**

Based on this analysis, I would recommend that the CEO actually cuts drivers in the urban areas. This is the only region where there are actually less rides than total drivers. This would increase the average fare per driver and increase total fares. I would also recommend that he experiments with increasing drivers in rural areas. PyBer has the best average fare per driver there and with more drivers they could potentially increase total fares. Lastly, I would recommend that the CEO looks into the times of spiking total fares. It looks like some spikes could be during times of holidays like St. Patrickâ€™s day and Easter. If that is the case then they could increase drivers on these days to potentially capture surges in demands.
